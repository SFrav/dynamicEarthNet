# DynamicEarthNet - agriculture applications 

This repo contains helper scripts to process the DynamicEarthNet dataset for applications related to agriculture. The preprint is [available here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12560.pdf) and data is [accessible here](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1650201).

Uses:
- Create a vector file of AOI footprints

Todo:
- Categorise AOIs into agriculture and non-agriculture depending on percent coverage of agriculture according to segmentation labels
- Derive 'land management zones' based on temporal segmentation
